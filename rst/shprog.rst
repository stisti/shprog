Shell Programming Pitfalls and Style Guide
==========================================

Introduction
============

After having written and read a lot of shell scripts, I began to see there are some common mistakes the novice script writers make. Often the scripts seem to work, but they are hard to read, inefficient or they might fail when they are run in a way their author did not expect. Every programming language has its own idioms, ways of doing things, kind of like rules of thumb. It's the same with shell scripts. The following tutorial tries to help the novice to learn these idioms and thus become a better shell scripter.
