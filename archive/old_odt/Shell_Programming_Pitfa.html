<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  After having written and read a lot of shell scripts, I began to see there are
  some common mistakes the novice script writers do. Often the scripts seem to
  work, but they are hard to read, inefficient or they might fail when they are
  run in a way their author did not expect. Every programming language has its
  own idioms, ways of doing things, kind of like rules of thumb. It's the same
  with shell scripts. The following tutorial tries to help the novice to learn
  these idioms and thus become a better script writer.
</p>
<h1 class=western>
  True and False Reversed
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Every UNIX process has an exit value which is made available to the parent
  process. A long-standing convention states that the exit value zero indicates
  success and any other value some kind of error.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Since every command used in a shell script is a UNIX process, the same
  applies: zero is true and anything else is false. This runs contrary to the
  established convention from the C language where zero is false and anything
  else is true. However, if one manages to unlearn what has been taught in the C
  classes, life becomes much easier for the script writer.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br class=webkit-block-placeholder>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Let's look at some examples. The script below is what a novice shell-scripter
  usually writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">grep pattern file<br>ret=$?<br>if [ $ret -eq 0 ]; then<br>	echo 'Found it!'<br>else<br>	echo 'Not found'<br>fi</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Compare that with the script from a more seasoned professional:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">if grep pattern file; then<br>	echo 'Found it!'<br>else<br>	echo 'Not found'<br>fi</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  The pro might even pull it off using a one-liner:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">grep pattern file &amp;&amp; echo 'Found it!' || echo 'Not found'</pre>
</blockquote>
<h1 class=western>
  Commands Usually Have a Useful Exit Value
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  It is common for the novice scripter to check for the output of the grep
  command. Look at the code sample below:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">isdriverloaded() {<br>    addeddriver=`modinfo | grep fsvpn`<br>    if [ -z "$addeddriver" ]; then<br>        return 0<br>    fi<br>    return 1<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  What we really want to know is if grep found any lines matching the pattern.
  The grep command has a useful exit value, it returns zero (success) if one or
  more matches were found. So, instead of storing the (possibly large) output
  from grep, which we really don't care about, we should be checking grep's exit
  value. Note that the script writer has also committed the sin described in the
  previous section: failing to grasp that zero is true and 1 is false. A better
  version of the function would read:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">isdriverloaded() {<br>	modinfo | grep fsvpn &gt;/dev/null<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  To learn why it works, look at the explanation in the next section.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br class=webkit-block-placeholder>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  The <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">tty</span> command prints the name
  of the terminal device the process is attached to, or "not a tty" if there is
  no terminal. Again, the novice would capture the output of the
  <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">tty</span> command and check that
  somehow:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">if&nbsp;[&nbsp;"`tty`"&nbsp;=&nbsp;"not&nbsp;a&nbsp;tty"&nbsp;];&nbsp;then
  </font><br>
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "a
  hard-to-read way of checking for tty"</font><br>
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">fi</font><br>
</blockquote>
<font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'"><font face=Arial>or<br>
</font></font>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">if tty | grep "not a tty" &gt;/dev/null;
  then</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "just as bad"</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">fi</font><br>
</blockquote>
<font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial>We are depending on the exact output
of that command. In the former example above, we capture the command output,
then invoke the <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">test</span> command to
compare it. (The <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">test</span> command is
also known as <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">[</span>, the opening
bracket.) In the latter example, we also invoke two processes, only this time
they run at the same time.<br>
<br>
A better way would be to notice the
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">tty</span> command has an exit code and
using it makes the script very readable and efficient and it would work even
when the user's locale settings make
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">tty</span> talk in japanese or tagalog:<br>
</font></font>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">if ! tty &gt;/dev/null; then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Look ma! No tty!"<br>
  fi<br>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h1 class=western>
  Invisible Exit Value
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Shell functions always return a value, even when there is no return statement
  anywhere in the function. In such a case the exit value will be the exit value
  of the last process executed in the shell function. Consider the following
  function:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">stop() {<br>	[ -x /etc/init.d/service ] &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/service stop<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  If you are checking the exit value from this function, you might be surprised.
  The exit value may not be the exit value of the <code class=western>/etc/init.d/service</code>. If the file <code class=western>/etc/init.d/service</code> was
  not executable or did not exist at all, the function would return a value
  indicating failure. You might be well advised to add an explicit <code class=western>return
0</code> to the
  end of the function.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Of course, sometimes this behaviour is exactly what you want:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">isrunning() {<br>	[ -e /var/run/daemon.pid ] &amp;&amp; \<br>	kill -0 `cat /var/run/daemon.pid` 2&gt;/dev/null<br>}</pre>
</blockquote>
<h1 class=western>
  Use true and false instead of 1 and 0<br>
</h1>
<span style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>When you want to use a variable like a Boolean,
some people do it like this:</span><br>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">upgrade=1</font><br>
  <br>
  <font face="Courier New">if [ $upgrade -eq 1 ]; then</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  do_upgrade</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">fi</font><br>
</blockquote>
<font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial>The code is much more readable when
written like this:<br>
</font></font>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial><font face="Courier New">upgrade=true</font></font></font><br>
  <br>
  <font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial><font face="Courier New">if
  $upgrade; then</font></font></font><br>
  <font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  do_upgrade</font></font></font><br>
  <font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial><font face="Courier New">fi</font></font></font><br>
</blockquote>
<font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial><font face="Courier New"><font face=Arial>This
is possible because there are commands true and false.
<font face="Courier New">true<font face=Arial> is a real command that lives in
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">/usr/bin</span> or possibly in
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">/bin</span>. When you execute true, it
does nothing except exits with code 0, which means success.<br>
<br>
Similarly, there is the command
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">false</span>, which does nothing and exits
with code 1 meaning failure.</font></font></font></font></font></font><br>
<h1 class=western>

<h1 class=western>
  Quoting For Fun and Profit
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Quoting is simple, at least in principle. There are just two types of quotes:
  single quotes ('') and double quotes (“”). Shell variables are expanded inside
  double quotes. Nothing is expanded inside single quotes. Any quotes disable
  filename expansion. Regarding filenames, it is usually a good practice to
  enclose variables that may contain filenames into double quotes. You'll never
  know when you encounter a filename with a space in it. Leave the filename
  without double quotes only when you have a filename with wildcard characters
  in it that you want the shell to expand.<br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Another difficult area is nested quoting. This kind of situation can arise for
  example when passing shell variables into an awk or perl script. See this
  script that prints out the login shell of a user.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">awk -F: '$1 == "'”$1”'" { print $7 }' /etc/passwd</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  The first single quote is interpreted by the shell, which means the next
  double quote is passed to awk as is. The second $1 is found quoted in double
  quotes, so the shell replaces it with the first command line argument. The
  double quotes are needed just in case the $1 contains spaces. Then the single
  quotes protect the rest of the awk script from expansion. The script which is
  seen by the awk interpreter is (assuming 'ftp' was the first argument):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">$1 == "ftp" { print $7 }</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Sometimes splitting quotes could become overwhelming, especially if the text
  you want to splice in contains quotes. Then you might want to use a mechanism
  built into awk precisely for this purpose, the -v option:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">awk -F: -v user=root '$1 == user { print
  "login shell for", user, "is", $7 }' /etc/passwd</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The -v option originated from GNU version of awk and has since spread into
  other awk implementations, just be aware it might not be everywhere.<br>
</p>
<h1 class=western>
  Using Bashisms and Gnuisms
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Bash, the Bourne Again shell from the GNU project, is pretty popular these
  days with Linux everywhere you look. However, there are still a couple of
  other UNIX flavours hanging around and Bash is not usually installed there.
  Shell scripts should try to be as operating system independent as possible.
  The only way to accomplish this is to only use features present in the
  original Bourne shell, the /bin/sh. This can be tricky because these days most
  script writers have been brought up on Linux. They are used to using the nifty
  features of bash and other GNU tools. They are absolutely dumbfounded when
  they have to make their script run on Solaris or HP-UX for the first time.
  Here is a list of things I've come across that will fail on non-Linux
  platforms.
</p>
<h2 class=western>
  Use of $(( )) for arithmetic evaluation
</h2>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  In bash you can do
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">a=$((5 * 6 + 2))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  But in the one true shell the only command that knows arithmetic is <code class=western>expr.</code>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">a=`expr 5 \* 6 + 2`</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 class=western>
  Use of tilde (~) to reference the home directory
</h2>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  In bash you can use the tilde (<code class=western>~</code>) to refer to your home directory and
  <code class=western>~user </code>to refer to a specified user's home directory.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  In the one true shell your home directory is <code class=western>$HOME</code>. Someone else's home
  directory can only be found by looking it up from <code class=western>/etc/passwd</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">awk -F: '$1 == “user” { print $6 }' /etc/passwd</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 class=western>
  Use of &gt;&amp; to redirect both stdout and stderr
</h2>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  In bash (and csh) you can redirect both standard output and standard error
  streams to a file with a convenient shorthand.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">command &gt;&amp;file</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  But in the one true shell you have to spell it out in full.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">command &gt;file 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
</blockquote>
<h1 class=western>
  Order of Redirections
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  What is the difference of the following command lines?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">command &gt;file 2&gt;&amp;1<br>command 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;file</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  The first is the one you probably wanted. It reads like this: “Redirect
  standard output to a file. Then redirect standard error to where standard
  output is attached.” Both streams will be written to the same file.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  The second command line reads: “Redirect standard error to where standard
  output is attached (probably a terminal). Then redirect standard output to a
  file.” The errors will appear on the terminal and output will be written to
  the file.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  There are two things to remember. One, the redirections are processed from
  left to right. Two, the notation <code class=western>2&gt;&amp;1
</code>does not make stderr to go stdout,
  instead it attaches stderr to where stdout was attached <i>at this moment</i>.
  In the second case above, the standard output was still connected to the
  terminal when the first redirection was being processed.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  OK, then how do you send both stdout and stderr to another command?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">make 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is a special case. Above it was emphasized you <i>first</i> change where
  stdout goes and only <i>then</i> pipe everything else to stdout. Not here. The
  reason is you really have 2 commands connected by a pipe. Piping is not the
  same as redirecting.<br>
</p>
<h1 class=western>
  Backticks and Command Line Length
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Many programmers know that the maximum length of a command is very limited in
  MS-DOS. UNIX programmers seem to think they have an infinite command length or
  at least the length is so long they don't have to worry about it. The prime
  example is what happens when you put the find command inside backticks.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">wc -l `find . -type f`</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  This works fine as long as the number of files printed by the find is less
  than the maximum command line length of the operating system. It might work
  for you when you test it. But does it work for someone using your script? Why
  not be sure and use xargs?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">find . -type f | xargs wc -l</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  By the way, both of the above will fail miserably if there are filenames with
  spaces. There is no way to make the first command work properly. The second
  command can be made to work with minor modifications:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">find . -type f | xargs -I xxx wc -l xxx</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">xargs</font> will read lines
  from its standard input and run
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">wc -l</font> with
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">xxx</font> replaced with one
  line, over and over again until all lines from stdin are exhausted.
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">xargs</font> is free to run
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">wc -l</font> with more than
  one argument, if the replacement of
  <font class=Apple-style-span face="'Courier New'">xxx</font> with multiple
  lines does not exceed the maximum command line length.
</p>
<h1 class=western>
  $@ vs. $*
</h1>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Often you write a small script to act as a front-end to some other utility.
  Typically these scripts check invoke some process with all the remaining
  command line arguments. Some script-writers use the <code class=western>$*</code> and some <code class=western>$@</code>. Is
  there a difference? Does it matter? Yes it does.
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  First of all, both <code class=western>$@</code> and <code class=western>$*</code> need to be enclosed in double quotes to
  work properly (<code class=western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">“$@”</code> and <code class=western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">“$*”</code>). Unquoted, they behave the same. Let's examine
  the issue with some examples. First, let's write a script called <code class=western>printargs.sh</code> that
  only prints it arguments.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">#!/bin/sh<br>for a; do<br>        echo "$a"<br>done</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Then write a script called <code class=western>argtest.sh</code> that tries out the different possibilities.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">#!/bin/sh<br>echo 'Using $@'<br>./printargs.sh $@<br>echo 'Using $*'<br>./printargs.sh $*<br>echo 'Using "$@"'<br>./printargs.sh "$@"<br>echo 'Using "$*"'<br>./printargs.sh "$*"</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  Then we execute it and see the following output.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class=code-sample-western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">./argtest.sh “1 2” 3<br>Using $@<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>Using $*<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>Using "$@"<br>1 2<br>3<br>Using "$*"<br>1 2 3</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class=western style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial>
  As you see, usually you want the behaviour of the <code class=western style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">“$@”</code>. Anything else will
  bite you in the backside when someone gives your script an argument that
  contains a space.
</p>
<h1 class=western>
  Lock files
</h1>
Sometimes you can only have one instance of your script running. Perhaps you are
updating some important system files and you must be sure it all works properly,
even if two different root users are logged on and invoke your script with no
idea another admin is already doing the same thing. Your script must take some
kind of lock before starting to do its work and then release the lock when it is
done.<br>
<br>
A lock could be the existence of a file. But how do you both create a file and
fail to create it if it already existed? You have two possibilities: a hard link
and a directory. Creation for both of them is an atomic operation that will fail
if the thing already exists.<br>
<br>
You could do something like this:<br>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">echo $$ &gt; lock.$$</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">if ln lock.$$ lockfile; then</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Lock acquired"</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">else</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Failed to get the lock"<br>
  fi<br>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<p>
  But what if an instance of that script died while holding the lock? You must
  set up a trap statement that will remove the lockfile when something
  unexpected happens.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">trap "rm -f lock.$$ lockfile" EXIT SIGHUP SIGTERM
  SIGINT<br>
  </font> <font face="Courier New">echo $$ &gt; lock.$$</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">if ln lock.$$ lockfile; then</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Lock acquired"</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">else</font><br>
  <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Failed to get the lock"<br>
  fi<br>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Something bad might still happen. Your script is killed with "kill -9" or the
  power fails. Whatever. The fact of the matter is that when your script runs,
  lockfile exists and it never gets the lock. That's why the lockfile is a link
  to a file that has the PID of the process that created it. We can simply check
  if that process exists.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <font face="Courier New">echo $$ &gt; lock.$$<br>
    trap "rm -f lock.$$ lockfile" EXIT SIGHUP SIGTERM SIGINT<br>
    </font> <font face="Courier New">if ln lock.$$ lockfile; then</font><br>
    <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Lock acquired"</font><br>
    <font face="Courier New">else</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">lockholder=`cat lockfile`</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if kill -0
    $lockholder; then</span><br>
    <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo
    "Failed to get the lock, lock is held by $lockholder"</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm -f
    lockfile</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo
    "Lock was held by $lockholder (died), try again now"<br>
    </font>

  Something like that. Or you could have a loop trying the hard link over and
  over as long as it takes for it to succeed.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  But what if the process-id read from the lockfile is an existing process, it's
  just not an instance of your script? Now things get tricky. In general, there
  might not be a portable solution, but if you can forget portability, there are
  things you can do.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If you can check when a process was launched, you can compare it against the
  modification time of lockfile. If they are reasonably close, then the creator
  of the lockfile is probably still alive.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Handling lock files correctly is a difficult problem that few programs get
  right. A better way would be to make lockfile be a unix domain socket instead
  of a file. Then checking if the lock holder was still alive would be a simple
  matter of connecting to the socket. If the connection was refused, there was
  no-one home. If the connection was established, you could talk to the other
  end and ask if the lock holder was still ok. Possibly the lock holder could
  even reply with an estimate of how long it is going to hold the lock. But, if
  the connection was refused, you would have to remove the stale socket and try
  bind a new one.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Unix domain sockes, unfortunately, are not easily manipulated from a shell
  script. You could make a Perl script that created the socket and responded to
  anyone connecting to it. But then you would need to run that Perl script in
  the background, executing in parallel with your script. Which you can do, just
  see below.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Another possibility would be to use advisory file locks (flock/fcntl/lockf)
  but again, they are not accessible to shell scripts, but they are to Perl. The
  advantage of file locks is they are unlocked by the operating system if the
  process holding the lock should die.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  You could use a helper like this:

  }<br>

  flock($LOCK, LOCK_UN);<br>
  close($LOCK);<br>
  exit 0;<br>

<p>
  The shell script would acquire the lock by running the Perl script, capturing
  Perl's standard output and verifying its exit code. If the exit code was
  nonzero, lock was not acquired. If the exit code was zero, standard output
  will contain the id of the process that needs to be killed to release the
  lock.<br>

<h1>
  Doing more than one thing at the same time<br>
</h1>
Normally your script only has one thread of execution, it runs the commands one
at a time, or one pipeline at a time. Sometimes you need to do more. For
example, you might want to run a script which takes a long time and you want to
make sure it does not take more than 3 hours.<br>
<h1>
  Assumption is the mother of all ...<br>
</h1>
<h2>
  Locale and language
</h2>
These days users of modern Unix systems expect the operating system and
applications to be localized. This is a benefit to the end-users who might not
be fluent in English, but it is bad for the script writer: Applications might
produce output which is completely different from what you expect. Also, you may
get bug reports from your users with error messages in japanese or some other
language you don't know that well.<br>
<br>
The careful scripter will put these lines somewhere at the beginning of their
script:<br>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">LANG=C<br>
  export LANG<br>
  </font>
</blockquote>
This will make everything executed after it use the "C" locale, where programs
produce standardized output and error messages, in English.<br>
<br>
If your script needs to produce localized output, you can capture the user's
locale settings before replacing them with your own:<br>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Courier New">user_locale=`locale`<br>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If needed, you can restore them with:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <font face="Courier New">eval $user_locale</font><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
  PATH lookup
</h2>
If your script needs /usr/bin/X11 to be in PATH, do not assume it is there. If
you need something to be in PATH, add it there.<br>
<h2>
  UMASK and default permissions
</h2>
When your script creates files, even temporary files, you might want to be
explicit with the permissions they are created with. If your script deals with
user's data and the point of the script is not to share the data, set umask to
0066. It is better to create files with tight permissions and then relax for
those few files that need relaxing. If you create files that are world-readable
and then remove the world-readability after creation, there will be a window of
time during which the file will be readable by everyone and sometimes that is
all the attacker needs.<br>
<h2>
  Echo does not support -n or -e
</h2>
Sometimes you want to be fancy in your printouts, you want to prevent
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">echo</span> from printing the newline at
the end of the line or something else: you want to call
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">echo</span> with the -n or -e option.
Couple of points:<br>
<br>
First, when you call <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">echo</span>, it might
be a shell built-in command or it might be
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">/bin/echo</span>. They might behave
differently.<br>
<br>
Second, the <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">echo</span> you call might not
support -n or -e or either.<br>
<br>
It is best to use <span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">echo</span> without
options and when you need better control for printout, use
<span style="FONT-FAMILY:Courier New">printf</span>.<br>
