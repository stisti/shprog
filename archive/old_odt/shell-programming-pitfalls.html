<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">After</SPAN>
having written and read a lot of shell scripts, I've began to see
that there are some common mistakes the novice script writers do.
Often the scripts do work, but they are not easy to read. Every
programming language has its own idioms, ways of doing common things.
It's the same with shell scripts. The following tutorial tries to
help the novice to learn these idioms and thus become a better script
writer.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">True and False Reversed</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Every UNIX process has an exit value which is made
available to the parent process. A long-standing convention states
that the exit value zero indicates success and any other value some
kind of error.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since every command used in a shell script is a
UNIX process, the same applies: zero is true and anything else is
false. This runs contrary to the established convention from the C
language where zero is false and anything else is true. However, if
one manages to unlearn what has been taught in the C classes, life
becomes much easier for the script writer. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Let's look at some examples. The script below is
what a novice shell-scripter usually writes:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">grep pattern file
ret=$?
if [ $ret -eq 0 ]; then
	echo 'Found it!'
else
	echo 'Not found'
fi</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Compare that with the script from a more seasoned professional:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">if grep pattern file; then
	echo 'Found it!'
else
	echo 'Not found'
fi</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The pro might even pull it off using a one-liner:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">grep pattern file &amp;&amp; echo 'Found it!' || echo 'Not found'</PRE><H1 CLASS="western">
Quoting For Fun and Profit</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Quoting is simple, at least in principle. There
are just two types of quotes: single quotes ('') and double quotes
(&ldquo;&rdquo;). Shell variables are expanded inside double quotes.
Nothing is expanded inside single quotes. Any quotes disable filename
expansion. What this all means is that it is usually a good practice
to enclose variables that may contain filenames into double quotes.
You'll never know when you encounter a filename with a space in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Another difficult area is nested quoting. This
kind of situation can arise for example when passing shell variables
into an awk or perl script. See this script that prints out the login
shell of a user.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">awk -F: '$1 == &quot;'&rdquo;$1&rdquo;'&quot; { print $7 }' /etc/passwd</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The first single quote is interpreted by the shell, which means the
next double quote is passed to awk as is. The second $1 is found
quoted in double quotes, so the shell replaces it with the first
command line argument. The double quotes are needed just in case the
$1 contains spaces. Then the single quotes protect the rest of the
awk script from expansion. The script which is seen by the awk
interpreter is (assuming 'ftp' was the first argument):</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">$1 == &quot;ftp&quot; { print $7 }</PRE><P CLASS="western">
<BR><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Grep Has an Exit Value</H1>
<P CLASS="western">It is common for the novice scripter to check for
the output of the grep command. Look at the code sample below:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">isdriverloaded() {
    addeddriver=`modinfo | grep fsvpn`
    if [ -z &quot;$addeddriver&quot; ]; then
        return 0
    fi
    return 1
}</PRE><P CLASS="western">
What we really want to know is if grep found any lines matching the
pattern. The grep command has a useful exit value, it returns zero
(success) if one or more matches were found. So, instead of storing
the (possibly large) output from grep, which we really don't care
about, we should be checking grep's exit value. Note that the script
writer has also committed the sin described in the previous section:
failing to grasp that zero is true and 1 is false. A better version
of the function would read:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">isdriverloaded() {
	modinfo | grep fsvpn &gt;/dev/null
}</PRE><P CLASS="western">
To learn why it works, look at the explanation in the next section.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Invisible Exit Value</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Shell functions always return a value, even when
there is no return statement anywhere in the function. In such a case
the exit value will be the exit value of the last process executed in
the shell function. Consider the following function:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">stop() {
	[ -x /etc/init.d/service ] &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/service stop
}</PRE><P CLASS="western">
If you are checking the exit value from this function, you might be
surprised. The exit value may not be the exit value of the
<CODE CLASS="western">/etc/init.d/service</CODE>. If the file
<CODE CLASS="western">/etc/init.d/service</CODE> was not executable
or did not exist at all, the function would return a value indicating
failure. You might be well adviced to add an explicit <CODE CLASS="western">return
0</CODE> to the end of the function.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Of course, sometimes this behaviour is exactly
what you want:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">isrunning() {
	[ -e /var/run/daemon.pid ] &amp;&amp; \
	kill -0 `cat /var/run/daemon.pid` 2&gt;/dev/null
}</PRE><H1 CLASS="western">
Using Bashisms and Gnuisms</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Bash, the Bourne Again shell from the GNU project,
is pretty popular these days with Linux everywhere you look. However,
there are still a couple of other UNIX flavours hanging around and
Bash is not usually installed there. Shell scripts should try to be
as operating system independent as possible. The only way to
accomplish this is to only use features present in the original
Bourne shell, the /bin/sh. This can be tricky because these days most
script writers have been brought up on Linux. They are used to using
the nifty features of bash and other GNU tools. They are absolutely
dumbfounded when they have to make their script run on Solaris or
HP-UX for the first time. Here is a list of things I've come across
that will fail on non-Linux platforms:</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Use of bang (!) to negate the exit value of a
process.</H2>
<P CLASS="western">You need to do something when a condition is not
true:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">if ! isrunning; then
	startit
fi</PRE><P CLASS="western">
This only works in bash. For /bin/sh you should use</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">if isrunning; then : else
	startit
fi</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Actually, I believe a more readable solution is</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">isrunning || startit</PRE><H2 CLASS="western">
Use of $(( )) for arithmetic evaluation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">In bash you can do</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">a=$((5 * 6 + 2))</PRE><P CLASS="western">
But in the one true shell the only command that knows arithmetic is
<CODE CLASS="western">expr.</CODE></P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">a=`expr 5 \* 6 + 2`</PRE><H2 CLASS="western">
Use of tilde (~) to reference the home directory</H2>
<P CLASS="western">In bash you can use the tilde (<CODE CLASS="western">~</CODE>)
to refer to your home directory and <CODE CLASS="western">~user </CODE>to
refer to a specified user's home directory.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the one true shell your home directory is
<CODE CLASS="western">$HOME</CODE>. Someone else's home directory can
only be found by looking it up from <CODE CLASS="western">/etc/passwd</CODE>.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">awk -F: '$1 == &ldquo;user&rdquo; { print $6 }' /etc/passwd</PRE><H2 CLASS="western">
Use of &gt;&amp; to redirect both stdout and stderr</H2>
<P CLASS="western">In bash (and csh) you can redirect both standard
output and standard error streams to a file with a convenient
shorthand.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">command &gt;&amp;file</PRE><P CLASS="western">
But in the one true shell you have to spell it out in full.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">command &gt;file 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE><H1 CLASS="western">
Order of Redirections</H1>
<P CLASS="western">What is the difference of the following command
lines?</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">command &gt;file 2&gt;&amp;1
command 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;file</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The first is the one you probably wanted. It reads like this:
&ldquo;Redirect standard output to a file. Then redirect standard
error to where standard output is attached.&rdquo; Both streams will
be written to the same file.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The second command line reads: &ldquo;Redirect
standard error to where standard output is attached (probably a
terminal). Then redirect standard output to a file.&rdquo; The errors
will appear on the terminal and output will be written to the file.</P>
<P CLASS="western">There are two things to remember. One, the
redirections are processed from left to right. Two, the notation <CODE CLASS="western">2&gt;&amp;1
</CODE>does not make stderr to go stdout, instead it attaches stderr
to where stdout was attached <I>at this moment</I>. In the second
case above, the standard output was still connected to the terminal
when the first redirection was being processed.</P>
<P CLASS="western">OK, then how do you pipe both stdout and stderr to
another command?</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">make 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</PRE><H1 CLASS="western">
Backticks and Command Line Length</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Many programmers know that the maximum length of a
command is very limited in MS-DOS. UNIX programmers seem to think
they have an infinite command length or at least the length is so
long they don't have to worry about it. The prime example is what
happens when you put the find command inside backticks.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">Wc -l `find . -type f`</PRE><P CLASS="western">
This works fine as long as the number of files printed by the find is
less than the maximum command line length of the operating system. It
might work for you when you test it. But does it work for someone
using your script? Why not by sure and use xargs?</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">find . -type f | xargs wc -l</PRE><P CLASS="western">
By the way, both of the above will fail miserably if there are
filenames with spaces. There is no way to make the first command work
properly. The second command can be made to work with minor
modifications:</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">find . -type f | xargs -L 1 -I xxx wc -l xxx</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The <CODE CLASS="western">-L 1 </CODE>will make it treat each line as
separate argument. The <CODE CLASS="western">-I xxx </CODE>is
necessary to make the argument properly available to <CODE CLASS="western">wc</CODE>.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">$@ vs. $*</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Often you write a small script to act as a
front-end to some other utility. Typically these scripts check invoke
some process with all the remaining command line arguments. Some
script-writers use the <CODE CLASS="western">$*</CODE> and some <CODE CLASS="western">$@</CODE>.
Is there a difference? Does it matter? Yes it does.</P>
<P CLASS="western">First of all, both <CODE CLASS="western">$@</CODE>
and <CODE CLASS="western">$*</CODE> need to be enclosed in double
quotes to work properly (<CODE CLASS="western">&ldquo;$@&rdquo;</CODE>
and <CODE CLASS="western">&ldquo;$*&rdquo;</CODE>). Unquoted, they
behave the same. Let's examine the issue with some examples. First,
let's write a script called <CODE CLASS="western">printargs.sh</CODE>
that only prints it arguments.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">#!/bin/sh
for a; do
        echo &quot;$a&quot;
done</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Then write a script called <CODE CLASS="western">argtest.sh</CODE>
that tries out the different possibilities.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">#!/bin/sh
echo 'Using $@'
./printargs.sh $@
echo 'Using $*'
./printargs.sh $*
echo 'Using &quot;$@&quot;'
./printargs.sh &quot;$@&quot;
echo 'Using &quot;$*&quot;'
./printargs.sh &quot;$*&quot;</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Then we execute it and see the following output.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">./argtest.sh &ldquo;1 2&rdquo; 3
Using $@
1
2
3
Using $*
1
2
3
Using &quot;$@&quot;
1 2
3
Using &quot;$*&quot;
1 2 3</PRE><P CLASS="western">
As you see, usually you want the behaviour of the <CODE CLASS="western">&ldquo;$@&rdquo;</CODE>.
Anything else will bite you in the backside when someone gives your
script an argument that contains a space.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">My Variables Have Vanished!</H1>
<P CLASS="western">It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking all
the shell variables are global. They are not. They are global in one
shell instance, but you might not realize that you have instantiated
a new sub shell where your code is creating new variables or changing
the old ones. Everything works fine until the code exits the sub
shell and returns to the parent and the variables have magically
disappeared or reverted to their original values.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">[This thing
about shell functions does not seem to be true.]</SPAN> Shell code
executing in a shell function is actually executed in a sub shell.
Variables created there are not available in the parent shell i.e.
the calling code.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">fixdisplay() {
	DISPLAY=fixeddisplay
}
fixdisplay
# DISPLAY is still broken</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The only way to pass information from the shell function to the
caller is via the return value or echoing the returned data to
stdout. The caller should then enclose the function in backticks to
capture the output.</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">DISPLAY=`fixdisplay`</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Also, shell code executing inside parenthesis is running in a sub
shell. 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="code-sample-western">false || ( var=value ; true)</PRE><P CLASS="western">
The value of <CODE CLASS="western">var</CODE> is not available on the
next line.</P>
